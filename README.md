# Antisocial-Behavior-in-Northern-Ireland

As part of a recent dashboard project, I analyzed incidents of anti-social behaviour (ASB) in Northern Ireland and found that Belfast had the highest count of such incidents. It is worth noting that Belfast also has the highest population in the region, so it is not surprising that it would have the highest number of reported incidents of ASB.

While ASB has been declining in the region for years, there was a significant spike in 2020 which may be due to the introduction of lockdown measures and other restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit.

Additionally, my analysis found that incidents of ASB tend to be more frequent in the months of July, August, and October. There is generally a significant decrease in such incidents from October to February, followed by a gradual increase until reaching a peak in July again. This trend may be linked to the summer holiday season, which typically falls in the months of June, July, and August

===========================================================
I created a bar chart race using Python.
Through this bar chart race, I found that Belfast consistently had the highest count of antisocial behaviour and held the top position. Derry City & Strabane used to have the second highest count of antisocial behaviour until 2014, when it was overtaken by Armagh City Banbridge & Craigavon. It then dropped to the third position in 2017, when it was overtaken by Newry Mourne & Down. In 2018, Newry was in 8th position, but saw a gradual rise until reaching the third position in 2017, which it has maintained since.

Fermanagh & Omagh has consistently had the lowest count of antisocial behaviour, followed by Mid Ulster. Causeway Coast & Glens used to have a high count of antisocial behaviour, taking the 4th position in 2008, but saw a gradual decline until reaching the 7th position in 2013. Antrim & Newtownabbey also used to have a high count of antisocial behaviour, taking the 5th position in 2009, but has since seen a gradual decline and is now the 4th safest district in terms of antisocial behaviour
